\arguments{
\item{X}{Numeric matrix. Vectors will be coerced to matrix with \code{as.matrix} (if this is possible)}

\item{Y}{Numeric matrix. Vectors will be coerced to matrix with \code{as.matrix} (if this is possible)}

\item{n}{Integer. Number of joint PLS components. Must be positive!}

\item{nx}{Integer. Number of orthogonal components in \eqn{X}. Negative values are interpreted as 0}

\item{ny}{Integer. Number of orthogonal components in \eqn{Y}. Negative values are interpreted as 0}

\item{nr_folds}{Integer. Number of folds of CV}

\item{keepx_seq}{Numeric vector. A vector indicating how many variables/groups to keep for CV in each of the joint component of X. Sparsity of each joint component will be selected sequentially.}

\item{keepy_seq}{Numeric vector. A vector indicating how many variables/groups to keep for CV in each of the joint component of Y. Sparsity of each joint component will be selected sequentially.}

\item{groupx}{Character. A vecter or character indicating group names of the variables. The order of group names must correspond to the order of the vairables in X. If not provided, SO2PLS will be used.}

\item{groupy}{Character. A vecter or character indicating group names of the variables. The order of group names must correspond to the order of the vairables in Y. If not provided, SO2PLS will be used.}

\item{tol}{double. Threshold for power method iteration}

\item{max_iterations}{Integer, Maximum number of iterations for power method}
}
\value{
A list containing
   \item{x_1sd}{A vector with length n, giving the optimal number of variables/groups to keep for each X-joint compoent. One standard error rule is applied}
   \item{y_1sd}{A vector with length n, giving the optimal number of variables/groups to keep for each Y-joint compoent. One standard error rule is applied}
   \item{x}{A vector with length n, giving the optimal number of variables/groups to keep for each X-joint compoent, without applying the one standard error rule}
   \item{y}{A vector with length n, giving the optimal number of variables/groups to keep for each Y-joint compoent, without applying the one standard error rule}
